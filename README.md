# MazeSolverProject
Maze-Solver project using both Stacks and Queues for DFS and BFS traversal in C++.

This project implements a Maze Solver game in C++ using:
- Arrays
- Stacks and Queues
- Graphs
- DFS and BFS algorithms

## Features

- Load a maze from a file
- Print the maze in console
- Solve the maze using DFS or BFS
- Save solved mazes to new files
- Generate random mazes

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

this can be done using: git clone https://github.com/4hkut/MazeSolverProject.git

2. **Compile the code:**

Using: g++ main.cpp Maze.cpp Solver.cpp MazeGenerator.cpp -o MazeSolver

3. **Run:**
